Write the root folder containing the data matrices in the file "root.txt" for your convenience: 
the software starts looking for files right there.

In order to run the exploration tool, run the script "label_panorama" (for Matlab 2011-2012) or "label_panorama_2009" (for Matlab 2009)

Within the tool, load one or more datasets by selecting the data file and corresponding text files with the columns
and with the labels.
For instance, for this dataset:
1. Launch label_panorama
2. Click on "Dataset selection"
3. Select three files by shift-clicking: 'column_names.txt', 'label_legend.txt' and a run, e.g. 'S1-ADL1.dat'
4. Select the desired "label track" from the drop down box
5. Select the class ID to visualize. The histogram, occurrences, etc. are visualized.
6. Select one or more occurrences (ctrl-click) and one or more sensor channels (ctrl-click) and press 'stack' to visualize the corresponding signals.
